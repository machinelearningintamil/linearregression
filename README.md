# linearregression
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of Linear Regression for predictive modeling and analysis. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used to predict a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.


## Features
- Simple Linear Regression: Predict a dependent variable using one independent variable.
- Multiple Linear Regression: Predict a dependent variable using multiple independent variables.
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, feature scaling, and data normalization.
- Model Training: Train the linear regression model on datasets and visualize the relationship between variables.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- Visualization: Scatter plot with regression line to visualize the relationship between predictors and the target variable.

## Use Cases
- Predicting sales based on temperature.
- Estimating house prices based on features such as area, number of rooms, etc.
- Forecasting stock prices based on historical data.
- Analyzing the relationship between variables in any linear dataset.
